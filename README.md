- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HadiChaaban, I'm a student at the University of Michigan. I'm currently trying to explore different fields in computer science. I've played around and learned with Python web applications, Game development with Unity, Java Servers, and other small projects along the way. There's many applications for coding and I'm trying to find one I enjoy most. 
For the new year, I've been creating clones of popular mobile apps in different libraries and programming languages to learn the fundamentals of game design.
